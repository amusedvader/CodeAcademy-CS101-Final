# CodeAcademy-CS101-Final

This is a first project and as such will inevitably have some bugs. I've also left in some legacy code that I hope to utilize in the future. My sophistication with writing programs is quite limited right now. 

So if you want to give the program a try, download the folder and open up the mortgageMain file and click Run.

Feedback is appreciated.
